1. To push a repo from local machine to github, it needs to be pushed to a remote repo.

first, create a new repo on github. 
Then, create a remote using"git remote add origin <URL>"
Then, go to your directory you want to push, and "git push origin master"

2. You can add file and commit directly in your Github repo. These changes, however will not be reflected in your local repo.
To pull the changes on Github repo to your local repo:
use "git pull origin master"....(Since we want to pull the master branch and origin was the remote name we created.)
Now, both repos will also have the same commits.
