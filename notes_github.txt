1. To push a repo from local machine to github, it needs to be pushed to a remote repo.

first, create a new repo on github. 
Then, create a remote using"git remote add origin <URL>"
Then, go to your directory you want to push, and "git push origin master"

2. You can add file and commit directly in your Github repo. These changes, however will not be reflected in your local repo.
To pull the changes on Github repo to your local repo:
use "git pull origin master"....(Since we want to pull the master branch and origin was the remote name we created.)
Now, both repos will also have the same commits.

3. FORK on Github basically clones the repo to your Github account.

4. Suppose, both remote and local repos are ahead by 1 commit(i.e. commits that have not been pulled or pushed by the remote/local repo.), then "git fetch origin" will update the local repo by making a new branch off the "origin/master" branch(the branch that was master when last pulled.)
Then, the master and the updated branch can be merged locally.
If there is a Conflict while merging, then 1. edit and save the conflicting file
                                           2. git add
                                           3. git commit
                                           4. git push

__________________________________________________________
|git pull origin master = git fetch origin               |
|                         git merge master origin/master |

PULL REQUEST:

when you wish to make a change to any file and have it reviewed(by any contributor) before having comitted
    1.make a new branch, check it out and then make the changes.
    2.add,commit and then push the new branch to the repo.
    3. create a pull request on Github.
    4. once reviewed, the contributor will merge pull request.
